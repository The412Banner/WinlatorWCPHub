>  <summary><b>What does this hub do?</b></summary><br>
>
> **Winlator WCP Hub** uses an open automated build pipeline to distribute essential `wcp` packages and provide simple, useful information about each type.

> Honestly, I mostly made it for my own peace of mind. 😌

>  <summary><b>What exactly is Winlator-Bionic?</b></summary><br>
>
> ### Winlator-Bionic is a community fork based on [Pipetto-crypto](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto)’s project.
>
> It runs closer to Android’s native stack, using a more direct Vulkan path that can cut overhead and improve performance on many devices. It supports both Box64 and FEXCore/arm64ec containers and lets users mix and match components such as Wine builds and graphics layers through modular `wcp`.

> | Bionic builds | 📖 |
> |:-:|-|
> | [**Winlator-CMod**](https://github.com/coffincolors/winlator/releases) | Baseline Bionic build with excellent controller support. |
> | [**Winlator-Ludashi**](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi/releases) | Keeps up with the latest upstream code while remaining close to vanilla. Great performance. |
> | [**GameNative**](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative/releases) | Supports both glibc and bionic, featuring a sleek UI and Steam integration. |

### 🌀 FEXCore & Box64

<details>
<summary>💡Quick Info</summary>
<br>

| Type | 📖 |
|:-:|-|
| **FEXCore** | Prioritizes accuracy. On modern setups it can give you very good compatibility without too much fuss. |
| **Box64** | Aimed at practical performance rather than perfect accuracy. Its dynarec has plenty of room for tuning, so you can adjust it per game when something starts acting weird. |
| **WOWBox64** | Helps 32-bit Windows games run inside 64-bit Wine by bridging their old 32-bit calls to the 64-bit host. |

- If you see graphics/animation/physics glitches in older games, try experimenting with `BOX64_FASTNAN` `BOX64_FASTROUND` `BOX64_X87DOUBLE` `FEX_X87REDUCEDPRECISION`

<summary>🧐 <b>UNITY SETTINGS</b></summary>

### 🧠 Unity scripting backends

| Backend | 🔍 | 🫩 | 📖 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|-|
| **Old Mono** | `UnityEngine.dll` | ❌ | Very cumbersome, and even when it runs the performance drop is severe. |
| **Mono** | `Assembly-CSharp.dll` `/MonoBleedingEdge` | 🟡 | Used by most Unity games. Performance varies, but it generally runs. |
| **IL2CPP** | `GameAssembly.dll` | 🟢 | Performs well and tolerates more aggressive settings in most cases. |

- You can identify each backend by the folders and files it is located in 🔍

---

### ⚙️ General Modern Mono Settings

| FEXCore | 🏷️ | 📖 |
|:-:|:-:|-|
| **TSO** | `1` | Keep as is. |
| **MEMCPYSETTSO** | `0` | If you still get crashes/freezes with `TSO = 1`, set this to `1`. | 
| **VECTORTSO** | `0` | If you still get crashes/freezes with `TSO = 1` `MEMCPYSETTSO = 1`, set this to `1`. Very heavy. |
| **HALFBARRIERTSO** | `1` | Keep as is. |
| **MULTIBLOCK** | `0` | Once TSO-related settings are stable, you can try `1` for potential performance gains. |

| Box64 | 🏷️ | 📖 |
|:-:|:-:|-|
| **SAFEFLAGS** | `1` | If you still get crashes/freezes, set this to `2`. Very heavy. |
| **STRONGMEM** | `1` | If you still get crashes/freezes, set this to `2`. Very heavy. |
| **WEAKBARRIER** | `1` | Reduces the performance cost of `STRONGMEM`. Set to `0` if the game crashes. |
| **BIGBLOCK** | `0-2` | Official recommendation is `0`, but `2` often works fine in practice. |
| **FORWARD** | `128-256` | Higher values mainly increase the risk of subtle, unpredictable side effects. |
| **CALLRET** | `0` | Keep as is. |
| **WAIT** | `1` | `0` might help performance in heavily multithreaded or JIT-heavy workloads. |

- If you see graphics/animation/physics glitches in older games, try experimenting with `BOX64_FASTNAN` `BOX64_FASTROUND` `BOX64_X87DOUBLE` `FEX_X87REDUCEDPRECISION`

- DXVK `2.5.x` and later may show reduced performance when used with the `Turnip driver`.

<details>
  <summary>💡Quick Info</summary>
<br> 

| Type | 📖 |
|:-:|-|
| **sarek**    | A modernized fork of DXVK `1.10.x` with backported fixes to keep older GPUs with weaker Vulkan support more stable. If you’re still on `1.10.x`, this is a good one to try. |
| **gplasync** | `gpl` cache + `async` shader compilation to smooth out shader hitches and visible stutter. |
| **arm64ec**  | Designed to be paired with `FEXCore` to cut down translation work and keep overhead lower. |
