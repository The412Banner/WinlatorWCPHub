> [!NOTE]
> 2026/06/27
> - Assets have been refreshed.
> - binsem assets have been added.
> - [**Proton 11 Beta 5**](https://github.com/Arihany/WinlatorWCPHub/releases/tag/WINE) with several bug fixes. Updates will be irregular.
> - ARM64EC (and Fexcore) assets now use Valve-style build flags for better performance, though compatibility may be reduced.
> - `FEX Nightly` and `Box64` are no longer maintained because they are no longer part of my regular testing path.


> [!TIP]
> <details>
>  <summary><b>What does this hub do?</b></summary><br>
>
> **Winlator WCP Hub** uses an open automated build pipeline to distribute essential `wcp(tzst)` packages and provide simple, useful information about each type.
>
> Honestly, I mostly made it for my own peace of mind. 😌

>
> ### Winlator-Bionic is a community fork based on [Pipetto-crypto](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto)’s project.
>
> It runs closer to Android’s native stack, using a more direct Vulkan path that can cut overhead and improve performance on many devices. It supports both Box64 and FEXCore/arm64ec containers and lets users mix and match components such as Wine builds and graphics layers through modular `wcp`.

> |:-:|-|
> | [**Winlator-CMod [OUTDATED]**](https://github.com/coffincolors/winlator/releases) | Baseline Bionic build with excellent controller support. |
> | [**Winlator-Ludashi**](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi/releases) | Keeps up with the latest upstream code while remaining close to vanilla. Great performance. |
> | [**GameNative**](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative/releases) | Supports both glibc and bionic, featuring a sleek UI and Steam integration. |

- DXVK `2.5` and later may show reduced performance when used with the `Turnip driver`.

<details>
  <summary>💡Quick Info</summary>
<br> 

| Type | 📖 |
|:-:|-|
| **sarek**    | A modernized fork of DXVK `1.10.x` with backported fixes to keep older GPUs with weaker Vulkan support more stable. If you’re still on `1.10.x`, this is a good one to try. |
| **gplasync** | `gpl` cache + `async` shader compilation to smooth out shader hitches and visible stutter. |
| **arm64ec**  | Designed to be paired with `FEXCore` to cut down translation work and keep overhead lower. |
