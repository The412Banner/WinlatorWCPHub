> [!NOTE]
> 2026/08/28
> - Assets have been refreshed.
> - Added the DXVK bundled with Proton. (Just for fun)
> - The binsem asset was removed because its effect was negligible.
> - `FEX Nightly` and `Box64` are no longer maintained.


> [!TIP]
> <details>
>  <summary><b>What does this hub do?</b></summary><br>
>
> **Winlator WCP Hub** uses an open automated build pipeline to distribute essential `wcp(tzst)` packages and provide simple, useful information about each type.

> Honestly, I mostly made it for my own peace of mind. 😌

>
> ### Winlator-Bionic is a community fork based on [Pipetto-crypto](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto)’s project.
>
> It runs closer to Android’s native stack, using a more direct path that can cut overhead and improve performance on many devices. It supports both Box64 and FEXCore/arm64ec containers and lets users mix and match components such as Wine builds and graphics layers through modular `wcp`.

> | [**Winlator-CMod [OUTDATED]**](https://github.com/coffincolors/winlator/releases) | Baseline Bionic build with excellent controller support. |
> | [**Winlator-Ludashi**](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi/releases) | Keeps up with the latest upstream code while remaining close to vanilla. Great performance. |
> | [**GameNative**](https://github.com/utkarshdalal/GameNative/releases) | Supports both glibc and bionic, featuring a sleek UI and Steam integration. |

- DXVK `2.5` and later may show reduced performance when used with the `Turnip driver`.

  <summary>💡Quick Info</summary>
<br> 

| Type | 📖 |
|:-:|-|
| **sarek**    | A DXVK `1.10.x`-based fork for GPUs that cannot meet newer Vulkan requirements. Backports fixes, QoL changes, and game-specific configurations from newer DXVK releases. |
| **gplasync** | Adds asynchronous pipeline compilation alongside DXVK's Graphics Pipeline Library, with optional state-cache integration. It can reduce shader compilation stutter, but the benefit may be smaller on newer DXVK versions and drivers where upstream GPL already handles most of this work. |
| **arm64ec**  | ARM64EC build intended for use with `FEXCore`, allowing Wine/FEX to run more code through the ARM64EC path instead of relying entirely on x64 emulation, which can reduce translation overhead. |
